What was most helpful about thinking about design methods of your project?
Using agile methods as well as kanban and related methods was the most helpful. It also helped to have an open look at what can be done in the project and being able to change things as you go along, genereally "project reflexivity".
What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
What was most difficult was the nature of the project being combining complicated libraries together to work with Discord. If I could do it differently, I would have first done more research into how the libraries interact with eachother and possible issues that can occur.
What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
In the future, utilizing a longer research period or one that is more pointed with more specific tasks would be a better solution and would have resulted in faster solutions for issues.
What was most helpful about implementing, testing, and integration in your bot project?
What was most helpful for implementing, testing, and integration into the project was making sure that each person had their own job relating the project and that they could complete it totally. All the way from design to implementation.
What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
Implementation, testing, and integration was hardest when it came to hosting and user experience as it was difficult to reproduce issues, wherein we might encounter some issue with any of the three and were not able to reproduce it. In the future, it would be best to keep better logging so fixing issues doesn't require reproduction as often.
What implementation, testing, and integration methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
Using a service that helps with logging such as Cabin or a custom service which helps to identify errors as well as mere notifications of the bot completing tasks would be helpful.
What was most helpful about implementing kanban and code review in your project?
Code review and kanban made it very easy to visualize the project in terms of what needed to be done in order to complete it, as well as to visualize what stage of development we were in at any point.
What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
In the future, it would be best to be more specific about the naming of tasks within kanban, as tasks which are named vaguely can make it so that it is difficult to know where one task ends and another begins.
What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?
Kanban, automated deployment, as well as setting up automated  testing would be processes that I would want to try again in a future project.
Considering all the design methods, implementation practices, and software processes you've encountered---compare and contrast how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.
Kanban, while beneficial in it's visualization of the project, can sometimes lead to a misleading picture of the progress and harm progress more than it helps if not oriented correctly. Code reviews, while having the added bonus of making sure that code is "good", takes up a lot of development time and can be refined further. Working in sprints in an agile format can be good in that it helps the team to keep pace of the project, however it's important to note the time-frames that you decide on with sprints as it may be micromanaging in ways and not allow development time for features and force more development time on debugging or vice-versa.
